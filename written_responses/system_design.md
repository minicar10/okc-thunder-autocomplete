System Design Description

Autocomplete is a feature that allows users to see suggestions appear as they type in a search bar. This search engine will have autocomplete, allowing for users to search for players, teams, league in a much more streamlined and faster way. With this autocomplete feature, NBA staff, scouts, and coaches would benefit greatly from this feature as they would be able to find their desired information faster and easier through useful suggestions, saving time and increasing productivity.

To begin with, the users would begin their search with a frontend search bar. As the users type, the search bar would send AJAX requests to the backend. The backend would be built with a framework such as Flask or Django. This backend would process requests from the frontend and decide what data they would receive. From there, the search engine would index the data and be able to provide relevant suggestions. Redis would be preferred as it is fast and simple, which would fit the need of virtually all of the searches. All of the player, team, and league information would be stored in a PostgreSQL database. A Redis caching layer would also help by storing frequency queries temporarily, which would allow common searches to be answered more quickly without querying the database. All of the components would be containerized with Docker, helping with consistent deployment.

The goals are fast response times, relevant suggestions, and scalability. Fast responses using in-memory search technologies would be ensured. Relevance would be achieved through the usage of prefix-based matching and ranking metrics to let users instantly get meaningful suggestions. Docker containerization would also allow scalability to be a relatively smooth process.

The technologies that would be used in the system would first have the frontend send AJAX requests to the backend to be processed. On the backend, either Flask or Django can be used to interpret the request and retrieve it in Redis to achieve fast lookups of suggestions. Core data is stored in PostgreSQL, while Redis is used for caching reduces response times. Docker containerizes all of the components to make it easier to scale and deploy for future use.
